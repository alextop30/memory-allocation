# memory-allocation
C++ Implementation of Operating Systems Memory Allocation Concept

Deep explanation of the program is located in the program_description.doc file so please refer to it before using the code.

input.txt file is required for the program ot work correctly.

The executable file does expect 1 of 2 command line arguments which is either f or b - f for first fit, and b for best fit. The make file is written in a manner that allows user to make and run with the arguments automatically.

make runf - runs the executable with the first fit algorithm

make runb - runs the executable with the best fit algorithm

both runb and runf complete a make all command to update the executable!
